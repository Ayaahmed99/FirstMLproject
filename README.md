I developed a Machine Learning model using the scikit-learn library to predict student exam scores based on various academic and behavioral factors. The model leverages a Decision Tree Regressor, which I trained on a well-structured dataset after performing data preprocessing and feature selection. This approach enables the model to learn complex patterns and relationships between input features and exam performance, ultimately providing accurate and interpretable predictions.
